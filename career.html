      <h2>Early career (1987–1990)</h2>
      <p>
        Before the 1987 NBA draft, the Chicago Bulls had their eyes on Pippen.
        They orchestrated a trade with the Seattle SuperSonics, sending Pippen,
        who was selected fifth overall, to the Bulls. In return, the SuperSonics
        received the eighth pick, Olden Polynice, and future draft pick options.
        Initially, Pippen and Horace Grant, a 6-foot-10-inch power forward
        drafted 10th overall in 1987, served as backups to Brad Sellers and
        Charles Oakley, respectively. However, under the guidance of teammate
        Michael Jordan, who mentored and trained him, Pippen steadily improved
        his skills and learned new ones throughout his career. Jordan and Pippen
        often engaged in one-on-one matchups outside of team practices to
        enhance their offensive and defensive abilities. During the 1988 NBA
        Playoffs, Pippen secured the starting small forward position and helped
        the Bulls, led by Jordan, reach the conference semifinals for the first
        time in over ten years. As the new decade began, Pippen emerged as one
        of the league's top young forwards, achieving career highs in points
        (16.5 points per game), rebounds (6.7 rebounds per game), and field goal
        shooting percentage (48.9%). He also ranked third in steals (211) in the
        NBA, earning him his first NBA All-Star selection in 1990. The Bulls
        continued to make progress, reaching the Eastern Conference Finals in
        1989 and 1990 but falling short against the Detroit Pistons both times.
        Unfortunately, in the 1990 finals, Pippen suffered a debilitating
        migraine headache at the beginning of Game 7, greatly affecting his
        performance as the Bulls lost 93-74, with Pippen making only one of his
        ten field goal attempts.

      <h2>The Bulls' first three-peat (1991–1993)</h2>
      <p>
        During the 1990-91 NBA season, Pippen established himself as the Bulls'
        primary defensive anchor and a versatile scoring threat within Phil
        Jackson's triangle offense. With the support and guidance of Jordan,
        Pippen continued to refine his skills, particularly in shooting
        efficiency.[23] He achieved his first triple-double on November 23
        against the Los Angeles Clippers, contributing 13 points, 12 assists,
        and 13 rebounds in 30 minutes, resulting in a 105-97 victory.[24]
        Another triple-double followed on December 22 versus the Indiana Pacers,
        as Pippen recorded 18 points, 11 assists, and 10 rebounds in 41 minutes
        of play. He also added 1 steal and 1 block, shooting 54.5% from the
        field in a 128-118 win.[25] On February 23, Pippen reached his
        season-high of 43 points in a 129-108 triumph over the Charlotte
        Hornets. Alongside this scoring feat, he secured 4 rebounds, provided 6
        assists, and tallied 6 steals in just 31 minutes. Notably, he achieved
        an outstanding field goal percentage of 94.1%, making 16 out of 17
        attempts.[26] Pippen's third and final triple-double of the season
        occurred on April 4, leading the Bulls to a 101-91 victory against the
        New York Knicks. He concluded the game with 20 points, 12 assists, 10
        rebounds, and 4 steals while shooting 50% from the field in 42 minutes
        of action.[27] The Bulls concluded the season with an impressive record
        of 61-21, ranking first in the Central Division, first in the Eastern
        Conference, and second overall, with the Portland Trail Blazers securing
        the top spot. Pippen ranked second on the team in points per game (17.8)
        and steals (2.4), just behind Jordan, and second in rebounds per game
        (7.3) behind Horace Grant. Additionally, Pippen led the team in blocks
        per game (1.1) and assists per game (6.2).[28] He placed fifth in the
        NBA in steals, both in total and per game.[29] As a recognition of his
        contributions during the 1990-91 NBA season, Pippen received NBA
        All-Defensive Second Team honors.[28] The Bulls went on to defeat the
        Los Angeles Lakers in the 1991 NBA Finals, marking the beginning of
        their first three-peat. Pippen's defensive prowess earned him 10 NBA
        All-Defensive Team selections, including 8 appearances on the first
        team.

      <h2>Pippen without Jordan (1993–1995)</h2>
      <p>
        After Michael Jordan retired prior to the 1993-94 season, Scottie Pippen
        emerged from Jordan's shadow and took on a leading role. That season, he
        showcased his skills by earning the All-Star Game MVP award and becoming
        the top scorer, assist leader, and shot blocker for the Bulls.
        Additionally, he ranked second in the NBA for steals per game. Pippen's
        impressive stats included averaging 22.0 points, 8.7 rebounds, 5.6
        assists, 2.9 steals, and 0.8 blocks per game, with shooting percentages
        of 49.1% from the field and a career-best 32% from the 3-point line. His
        exceptional performance led to his first of three consecutive All-NBA
        First Team selections, and he finished third in MVP voting. Despite
        Jordan's absence, the Bulls managed to secure 55 wins that season, only
        two fewer than the previous year, thanks to key additions such as Toni
        Kukoč, Steve Kerr, and Luc Longley. However, Pippen's first year without
        Jordan was not without controversy. In the 1994 NBA Playoffs, the Bulls
        faced the New York Knicks in the Eastern Conference Semifinals. During
        Game 3, with the series at 2-0 in favor of the Knicks, Bulls coach Phil
        Jackson called for a crucial play designed for Toni Kukoč, with Pippen
        tasked with inbounding the ball. However, Pippen, who had been the
        team's leader in Jordan's absence, was furious with Jackson's decision
        and refused to re-enter the game after a timeout, resulting in Toni
        Kukoč hitting the game-winning shot at the buzzer. The incident was
        captured on television, showing a displeased Phil Jackson leaving the
        court. In a post-game interview, Jackson stated that Pippen asked to be
        excluded from the play, further adding to the controversy. Another
        significant moment in the series occurred during Game 5 when Pippen was
        called for a personal foul against the Knicks' Hubert Davis. With 2.1
        seconds remaining, Davis attempted a shot that Pippen defended, but the
        referee, Hue Hollins, ruled a foul. Replays indicated that contact
        occurred after Davis released the ball. Davis made both free throws,
        resulting in an 87-86 victory for the Knicks and giving them a three
        games to two advantage in the series. The call by Hollins was highly
        debated and considered one of the most controversial moments of his
        career. Despite criticism, Hollins defended his decision, stating that
        he observed contact during Davis' shooting motion. The league's
        supervisor of officials, Darell Garretson, supported Hollins' call
        initially but later described it as "terrible." The aftermath of the
        game saw Phil Jackson being fined $10,000 for comparing the loss to the
        disputed gold medal game at the 1972 Summer Olympics. In Game 6, Pippen
        delivered a memorable play in his career. During a Bulls fast break, he
        aggressively drove to the basket while being defended by Patrick Ewing.
        Pippen extended the ball, absorbed the contact and foul from Ewing, and
        completed a powerful slam dunk while Ewing fell to the ground. Pippen
        then taunted both Ewing and Spike Lee, who was seated courtside
        supporting the Knicks, resulting in a technical foul. This impressive
        play increased the Bulls' lead and contributed to their 93-79 victory.
        Despite Pippen's strong performance in Game 7, scoring 20 points and
        grabbing 16 rebounds, the Bulls were unable to secure a win, losing
        87-77. As a result, the Knicks advanced to the NBA Finals but were
        eventually defeated by the Houston Rockets in a seven-game series.
        During the 1994 offseason, trade rumors involving Pippen circulated,
