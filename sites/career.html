    <h2>Career</h2>
    <p>
      Before the 1987 NBA draft, the Chicago Bulls had their eyes on Pippen. They orchestrated a trade with the Seattle SuperSonics, sending Pippen, who was selected fifth overall, to the Bulls. In return, the SuperSonics received the eighth pick, Olden Polynice, and future draft pick options. Initially, Pippen and Horace Grant, a 6-foot-10-inch power forward drafted 10th overall in 1987, served as backups to Brad Sellers and Charles Oakley, respectively. However, under the guidance of teammate Michael Jordan, who mentored and trained him, Pippen steadily improved his skills and learned new ones throughout his career. Jordan and Pippen often engaged in one-on-one matchups outside of team practices to enhance their offensive and defensive abilities. During the 1988 NBA Playoffs, Pippen secured the starting small forward position and helped the Bulls, led by Jordan, reach the conference semifinals for the first time in over ten years. As the new decade began, Pippen emerged as one of the league's top young forwards, achieving career highs in points (16.5 points per game), rebounds (6.7 rebounds per game), and field goal shooting percentage (48.9%). He also ranked third in steals (211) in the NBA, earning him his first NBA All-Star selection in 1990. The Bulls continued to make progress, reaching the Eastern Conference Finals in 1989 and 1990 but falling short against the Detroit Pistons both times. Unfortunately, in the 1990 finals, Pippen suffered a debilitating migraine headache at the beginning of Game 7, greatly affecting his performance as the Bulls lost 93-74, with Pippen making only one of his ten field goal attempts.
