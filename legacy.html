        Pippen is renowned as one of the greatest defenders in basketball
        history and an exceptionally versatile and agile player overall. In
        2022, on the occasion of the NBA's 75th Anniversary, The Athletic ranked
        the top 75 players of all time, placing Pippen as the 32nd greatest
        player in NBA history. Similar to his teammate Michael Jordan, Pippen
        exhibited tenacious on-the-ball perimeter defense and was also effective
        as a help defender. His exceptional athleticism, even by professional
        athletes' standards, coupled with his basketball skills, set him apart.
        With his long arms (featuring a 2.2-meter wingspan) and leaping ability,
        Pippen disrupted passing lanes, blocked shots from behind, secured
        difficult rebounds, executed impressive mid-air plays, and made passes
        around defenders that most players couldn't accomplish. He often led the
        Bulls in assists and blocks, showcasing his well-rounded game. Pippen
        was known for his selflessness on the court, and his team-oriented
        approach played a crucial role in the Bulls' championship victories. His
        career total of 6,135 assists (averaging 5.2 per game) at the time of
        his retirement ranked 23rd all-time among all players, exemplifying his
        team-first mentality. Pippen's intense work ethic and remarkable
        physical abilities allowed him to consistently make highlight-reel
        plays, such as applying defensive pressure, causing turnovers, stealing
        the ball, and initiating fast breaks that he punctuated with powerful
        slam dunks. He displayed his leaping prowess during the 1990 Slam Dunk
        Contest with a dunk from the free-throw line. Pippen was an impressive
        finisher at the rim, utilizing both emphatic dunks and a refined finger
        roll as part of his skill set. He was also a prolific perimeter shooter
        for his era, tallying around 3,000 attempts and nearly 1,000 made
        three-pointers in his career. Several NBA players, including Jordan,
        Jason Kidd, and Karl Malone, have included Pippen in their all-time
        starting lineups. To commemorate the 20th anniversary of their first NBA
        Championship in 1991, the Chicago Bulls organization held a ceremony
        during halftime of a game against the Utah Jazz on March 12, 2011,
        honoring the 1991 championship team. Pippen and Jordan were present,
        reuniting with former teammates and coaches. The Bulls organization
        announced on March 17, 2011, that Pippen would be honored with a bronze
        statue at the United Center, the team's home arena. During the unveiling
        on April 7, 2011, in a halftime ceremony of a game against the Boston
        Celtics, Pippen expressed his gratitude for the incredible honor
        bestowed upon him.
